class AwaitableGenerator:
    """Wrap an asynchronous generator as optionally awaitable.

    For example, you may have a low level async function that generates
    results, but where in some cases you want to just wait for the gathered
    results.

    The 2 methods of handling results show belown are functionally equivalent,
    except that in the second example all results are generated before
    iteration begins.

    ```python

    async def some_generator():
        for x in range(0, 5):
            yield x

    async for result in AwaitableGenerator(some_generator()):
        do_something_with(result)

    for result in await AwaitableGenerator(some_generator()):
        do_something_with(result)

    ```

    By default results will be collected into a `list`, using the
    `async_list` function. You can specify a custom collector as
    an argument to the constructor.

    The generator can be called with `predicate` and `result`, which
    are optionally async callables the results of which determine
    whether to include a result and how to yield/return it respectively.

    These args are passed to the collector function when instances of
    this class are awaited.
