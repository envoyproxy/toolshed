## HOW THE ACTION WORKS

As you known, Git rejects non-fast-forward updates.
The action uses it for locking.

The action tries to push a commit that contains a random string.
If the pushing succeeds, it means that no concurrent jobs run.

```
$ echo "$RANDOM" > lock.txt
$ git add lock.txt
$ git commit -m 'add lock files'
$ git push origin HEAD:actions-mutex-lock/lock
To https://github.com/shogo82148/actions-mutex
 * [new branch]      HEAD -> actions-mutex-lock/lock
```

If the pushing fails, it means that a concurrent job is now running.
The action will retry to push after some wait.

```
$ echo "$RANDOM" > lock.txt
$ git add lock.txt
$ git commit -m 'add lock files'
$ git push origin HEAD:actions-mutex-lock/lock
To https://github.com/shogo82148/actions-mutex
 ! [rejected]        HEAD -> actions-mutex-lock/lock (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/shogo82148/actions-mutex'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
