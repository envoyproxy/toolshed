# Per-test lcov merger (`--coverage_output_generator`) that strips the records the
# combined report does not read.
#
# Bazel runs the merger once per test (in the coverage postprocessing spawn) to turn the
# raw coverage data into the test's `coverage.dat`. Every one of those files describes
# the whole instrumented binary, and in a large C++ tree most of the bytes are function
# (`FN`/`FNDA`) and branch (`BRDA`) records: thousands of mangled names per file, repeated
# for every test. Line coverage, which is what the thresholds are validated against, is a
# small fraction. Stripping the rest shrinks every per-test file several-fold before it is
# uploaded, downloaded and merged into the combined report.
#
# Zero-hit `DA` lines are kept: the baseline report only lists files, so a line no test
# hits would otherwise disappear from the combined report rather than count as uncovered.
#
# Arguments are passed through unchanged to Bazel's merger. The merged report is filtered
# in place afterwards, so the wrapper is transparent to `collect_coverage.sh`.
